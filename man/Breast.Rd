\title{Breast cancer cell line data}
\description{ This data set comes from a breast cancer cell line
microarray study. The experiment was done as
follows. First, the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was treated
with 17 beta-estradiol or ethanol (vehicle control). Then,
samples were harvested at 1, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours
after treatment. At each time point, M = 8 replicate arrays
were prepared with each array consisting of G = 1901
genes.}
